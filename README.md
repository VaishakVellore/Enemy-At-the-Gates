# Enemy-At-the-Gates
The idea behind creating the game came from something which we played when we were kids and it was called Space Impact which is a mobile game series that was developed by Nokia. Space Impact is a shoot 'em up game and the player has the ability to freely move horizontally and vertically. We developed a newer version for the game with improved graphics.
